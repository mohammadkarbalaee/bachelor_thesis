abstract = {In the future, intelligent transportation systems will rely heavily on vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication-based cooperative vehicular networks since they can provide several applications for tackling traffic congestion and road safety. Future 6G and New Radio 5G (NR5G) technology will facilitate improving cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication performance. Cellular-assisted V2V communications, in which cellular evolved Node base stations (eNBs) relay the transmission from one vehicle to another, have lately been proposed to overcome the performance restrictions of conventional dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) protocols (Kimura in IEEE Trans Veh Technol 70(4): 3396--3411, 2021. 10.1109/TVT.2021.3063694). These cellular-aided communications have demonstrated the potential for more reliable V2V communications with a larger capacity and longer transmission distances. In this paper, we theoretically examine the effectiveness of cellular vehicle to everything communications, where a vehicle broadcasts a message to its nearby vehicles or user equipment (UEs). It happens in two ways, i.e., direct vehicle to vehicle and via the closest eNB through an uplink. Then the closest eNB forwards the message to the destination vehicle via downlink i.e., vehicle to network (V2N) or vehicle to infrastructure (V2I). To obtain a suitable model for estimating the Bit Error Rate (BER) and the Packet Error Rate (PER), we consider the movement of three vehicles are in a straight line on the roadways with different velocities. Using numerical examples, we assess the analytical findings and show how different system factors affect the effectiveness of CV2X communications. A simulation has been carried out in the network (system) level context.},

abstract = {Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is a promising area for research in wireless communication as it provides an improved performance for safe connectivity of autonomous vehicles over half duplex (HD) Direct Short Range Communication (DSRC) in terms of range, reliability and infrastructure cost. In this work, full duplex (FD) communication for Base Stations (BSs) over shared channels is presented for the first time in C-V2X networks. Three modes, Mode A, B and C have been defined based on autonomous, cellular HD and cellular FD communication. Network model has been built by plotting vehicles, pedestrians and traffic infrastructure according to Cox Process while BSs have been distributed according to 2-D Poisson Point Process (PPP) in a circular region. Mathematical model for success probability of FD communication over BSs in C-V2X networks using nearest neighbor criterion has been developed and same is compared with HD communication. Analytical results have also been compared with system model using Monte Carlo simulations. For the very first time, we have shown that success probability of FD is comparable with that of HD communication in terms of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) ranging from −40dB to 60dB, with less than 10{\%} degradation in the range from −15dB to 10dB, which is minimal. Other network characteristics like intensities of vehicles, roads and BSs have also shown minimal degradation (less than 10{\%}) in performance of FD as compared to HD for C-V2X network. Effect of imperfect self interference cancellation (SIC) for different values has also been presented to highlight significance of achieving perfect SIC for FD in C-V2X networks.},

abstract = {A key component of intelligent transportation systems is the so-called Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). These networks refer to a set of smart vehicles which provide communication services on the road using wireless technologies. In addition to enhancing road safety, VANETs can contribute to vehicle and driver’s security. Therefore, the research in this area is heavily centered around important security and privacy issues, in particular authentication of the messages exchanged while reducing communication overhead. In order to provide a solution to this problem, Zhong et al. recently proposed an efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme for VANETs based on certificateless aggregate signatures. In their scheme, the length of the aggregated signature is fixed and does not depend on the number of input signatures. The goal of our paper is to show that the scheme of Zhong et al. fails to provide the required authentication for VANETs. We prove that it is easily possible to forge the signature of a vehicle on an arbitrary message after observing only one pair of (message, signature) signed by the target vehicle. We further propose an improvement over Zhong et al.’s scheme that overcomes the mentioned drawback and therefore provides the required authenticity in VANETs.},

	abstract = {Avalanches present substantial hazard risk in mountainous regions, particularly when avalanches obstruct roads, either hitting vehicles directly or leaving traffic exposed to subsequent avalanches during cycles. Traditional detection methods often are designed to cover only a limited section of a road stretch, hampering effective risk management. This research introduces a novel approach using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) for avalanche detection. The monitoring site in Northern Norway is known to be frequently impacted by avalanches. Between 2022--2024, we continuously monitored the road for avalanches blocking the traffic. The automated alert system identifies avalanches affecting the road and estimates accumulated snow. The system provides continuous, real-time monitoring with competitive sensitivity and accuracy over large areas (up to 170 km) and for multiple sites on parallel. DAS powered alert system can work unaffected by visual barriers or adverse weather conditions. The system successfully identified 10 road-impacting avalanches (100{\%} detection rate). Our results via DAS align with the previous works and indicate that low frequency part of the signal (<20 Hz) is crucial for detection and size estimation of avalanche events. Alternative fiber installation methods are evaluated for optimal sensitivity to avalanches. Consequently, this study demonstrates its durability and lower maintenance requirements, especially when compared to the high setup costs and coverage limitations of radar systems, or the weather and lighting vulnerabilities of cameras. Furthermore the system can detect vehicles on the road as important supplemental information for search and rescue operations, and thus the authorities can be alerted, thereby playing a vital role in urgent rescue efforts.},

  abstract = {Traffic signs are characterized by a wide variability in their visual appearance in real-world environments. For example, changes of illumination, varying weather conditions and partial occlusions impact the perception of road signs. In practice, a large number of different sign classes needs to be recognized with very high accuracy. Traffic signs have been designed to be easily readable for humans, who perform very well at this task. For computer systems, however, classifying traffic signs still seems to pose a challenging pattern recognition problem. Both image processing and machine learning algorithms are continuously refined to improve on this task. But little systematic comparison of such systems exist. What is the status quo? Do today’s algorithms reach human performance? For assessing the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we present a publicly available traffic sign dataset with more than 50,000 images of German road signs in 43 classes. The data was considered in the second stage of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark held at IJCNN 2011. The results of this competition are reported and the best-performing algorithms are briefly described. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) showed particularly high classification accuracies in the competition. We measured the performance of human subjects on the same data—and the CNNs outperformed the human test persons.}
